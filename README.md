## üîÑ How Our Automated API Tracking Works

This repository leverages GitHub Actions to create a self-maintaining API directory that stays current without manual intervention:

### Automated Processes:

1. **Weekly API Status Checks**: Every Sunday at 00:00 UTC, our automation verifies all APIs are operational and updates their status
2. **Enhanced API Discovery**: Every Monday at 00:15 UTC, our enhanced scrapers collect high-quality free APIs from multiple sources
3. **Monthly API Discovery**: On the 1st of each month at 00:30 UTC, our system scans sources like RapidAPI, GitHub trending repositories, and ProgrammableWeb to find new popular APIs
4. **Daily Trending Repositories**: Every day at 01:00 UTC, we update the trending GitHub repositories section
5. **Daily Trending API Repositories**: Every day at 01:30 UTC, we update the trending GitHub API-specific repositories section
6. **Data Enrichment**: For each API, we automatically collect and verify information about authentication methods, HTTPS support, and CORS compatibility
7. **Trend Analysis**: APIs are ranked by popularity based on usage metrics and community adoption


This automation ensures you always have access to the most current and reliable free API information for your development projects.
