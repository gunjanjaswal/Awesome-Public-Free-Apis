## ü§ù How to Contribute to This API Collection

We welcome contributions from the community! If you know of a high-quality API that should be included in this collection, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your API to the appropriate category in the README.md file
3. Submit a pull request with a brief description of the API and why it should be included

Please ensure that any API you submit meets the following criteria:
- Free to use (may require registration)
- Has proper documentation
- Is actively maintained
- Provides direct access to the API (not through a third-party service)

## üîÑ How Our Automated API Tracking Works

This repository leverages GitHub Actions to create a self-maintaining API directory that stays current without manual intervention:

Automated Processes:
- **Weekly API Status Checks**: Every Sunday at 00:00 UTC, our automation verifies all APIs are operational and updates their status
- **Monthly API Discovery**: On the 1st of each month at 00:30 UTC, our system scans sources like RapidAPI, GitHub trending repositories, and ProgrammableWeb to find new popular APIs
- **Daily Trending Repositories**: Every day at 01:00 UTC, we update the trending GitHub repositories section
- **Data Enrichment**: For each API, we automatically collect and verify information about authentication methods, HTTPS support, and CORS compatibility
- **Trend Analysis**: APIs are ranked by popularity based on usage metrics and community adoption

This automation ensures you always have access to the most current and reliable free API information for your development projects. Each category includes only high-quality, verified APIs without any artificial limits on the number of APIs per category.
